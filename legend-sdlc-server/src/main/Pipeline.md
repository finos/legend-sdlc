## Kevin Questions
1. thoughts on pushing to maven central vs personal gitlab
2. project extension provider
   - should finos be the DeaultProvider or should there be a FinosProvider
   - can this be implemented after I merge. would rather commit this once the issues are resolved.
    


## Finos Strategy 
1. Figure out where we push artifacts (Maven vs personal repo)
2. Pushing to Maven; does the standard gitlab account let you do that now? 

## TODO
1. add tests from gitlab
2. bring in legend changes into alloy
3. TEST FULL flow in alloy
4. research the resolver of dependencies
5.
