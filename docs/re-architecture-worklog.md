# Re-architecture Implementation Worklog

Running log of the implementation of [`re-architecture.md`](re-architecture.md).
One section per phase; within a phase, newest entries last. Records what moved,
decisions taken where the plan allowed a choice, deviations from the plan, and
bugs observed-but-preserved (Phases 2–3 are behavior-preserving; fixes are logged
here and deferred). A fresh session should be able to resume from this file plus
`git log` on the `reorg` branch.

## Conventions adopted (apply to all phases)

- **New package roots**: relocated classes leave `org.finos.legend.sdlc.server.*`
  per re-architecture §5. Chosen so far: `org.finos.legend.sdlc.tools` (shared
  utilities), `org.finos.legend.sdlc.error` (framework-free exceptions). These
  follow the existing non-server precedents (`…sdlc.serialization`,
  `…sdlc.domain.model.*`, `…sdlc.generation`).
- **Bridge pattern for classes**: old FQN retained as a `@Deprecated` subclass of
  the relocated class, in the module that historically shipped the old FQN. The
  Javadoc says the bridge is retained *temporarily* — it does not promise a
  specific release cycle (removal timing is coordinated per re-architecture §5).
  Static utility methods are reachable through subclass names, so bridges for
  utility classes are empty subclasses (relocated utility constructors were made
  `protected` to permit this).
- **Build/verify**: `mvn install javadoc:javadoc` on Java 25 (matches
  `.github/workflows/build.yml`); checkstyle and `dependency:analyze`
  (`failOnWarning=true`) are active, so a green build implies both.

## Phase 1 — Foundations (completing `legend-sdlc-shared`)

**Status: complete** (this commit).

What moved:

- `StringTools`, `IOTools` (+ tests): `org.finos.legend.sdlc.server.tools` →
  `org.finos.legend.sdlc.tools`, staying in `legend-sdlc-shared`. `@Deprecated`
  empty-subclass bridges left at the old FQNs in `legend-sdlc-shared` (that is
  where the old FQNs currently ship on this branch). All in-repo references
  (22 files across `legend-sdlc-project-files`, `-server`, `-server-fs`,
  `-server-shared`) updated to the new package.
- `LegendSDLCServerException` → **`org.finos.legend.sdlc.error.LegendSDLCException`**
  in `legend-sdlc-shared`. The JAX-RS `Response.Status` field is replaced by a
  plain `int statusCode` (`getStatusCode()`); defaults preserved exactly
  (constructors default 500; `validate*` helpers default 400). Static `validate*`
  helpers mirrored with `int` overloads.
- `LegendSDLCServerException` remains in `legend-sdlc-server-shared` as a
  `@Deprecated` subclass: identical constructor signatures (`Status`-typed,
  null → 500), `getStatus()` now derived via `Status.fromStatusCode(getStatusCode())`
  (exact round-trip — all constructors take the enum), and its own static
  `validate*` helpers still constructing/throwing `LegendSDLCServerException` so
  existing catch sites and the JAX-RS mapper are unaffected.
  `TestLegendSDLCServerException` kept unchanged as the compat pin; new
  `TestLegendSDLCException` covers the int-based API.

Decisions / deviations:

- **Constructor visibility loosened on relocated utilities**: `StringTools`'s
  private constructor became `protected` (and `IOTools` gained an explicit
  `protected` one, where it previously had an implicit public default) so the
  deprecated bridges can extend them. Net API effect: `new IOTools()` is no
  longer possible for outsiders — it was never meaningful.
- **Serialization compatibility**: `LegendSDLCServerException` keeps its
  `serialVersionUID`, but its serialized shape changed (status now an `int` in
  the superclass instead of an enum field). Java-serialized instances of the old
  class are not deserializable across this change. Judged acceptable: these are
  server-side HTTP exceptions, never persisted; noted for the release notes.
- **Split package `org.finos.legend.sdlc.server.tools` persists** for the
  deprecation cycle: bridges in `legend-sdlc-shared`, plus 6 unrelated server
  classes (`AuthenticationTools`, `BackgroundTaskProcessor`, …) in
  `legend-sdlc-server`. Pre-existing condition; it ends when the bridges are
  deleted. The server-only classes in that package are Phase 4/5 material.
- **No exception mapper for `LegendSDLCException` yet**, deliberately: nothing
  below the server throws it until Phase 2 moves code down. Phase 2 must (a) add
  a JAX-RS mapper (or extend `BaseExceptionMapper`) for the new base type and
  (b) audit `catch (LegendSDLCServerException …)` sites on any path that will
  call relocated code, since relocated code will throw the base type, which those
  catches do not match.

Explicitly *not* done (deferred to their phases):

- `legend-sdlc-server-shared`'s other contents (auth/session, `BaseServer`,
  mappers, `BaseResource`) are server-ware and stay put (L6-adjacent).
- The 6 `server.tools` classes in `legend-sdlc-server` (above).
- Anything in `legend-sdlc-project-files` package renames (`server.project.*` →
  `projectfiles`) — that is Phase 2 territory alongside the `SourceSpecification`
  decision.

## Phase 2 — Project structure extraction

Not started. Inputs to carry in: seams S2 and R1 (re-architecture §6), the §5
migration recipe + dual-keyed `ServiceLoader` lookup, the extension-SPI interface
bridge, and the two Phase-1 notes above (mapper for `LegendSDLCException`; catch-site
audit).
